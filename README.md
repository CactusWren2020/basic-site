# basic-site
basic hand-coded html-css site

This is a bare-bones site. Features:

*fixed navbar with three links to anchors on the page
*large hero section with centered text and button to contact form
*about section with three equal columns, each which has images and text
*two-part form, with normal contact-info and a few checkboxes
*footer with copyright

I used the following design parameters:

Color
dark: #2a3d66
medium:  #5d54a4
mid: #9d65c9
light: #d789d7

Typography: Poppins (Google font)

h1: 121.5px
h2: 81px
h3: 54px
h4: 36px
h5: 24px
h6: 16px
small: 10.67px
 
This sizing is based on the "perfect fourth" concept. I only ended up using a few of the sizes and colors.
